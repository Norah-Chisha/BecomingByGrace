            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                Hello beautiful souls, and welcome to <b>Becoming By Grace</b> — a space where faith, 
                purpose, growth, and my journey in tech come together. <br><br>
                My name is <b>Norah Chisha</b>, a Computer Science student, an aspiring Software Engineer, 
                motivational writer, and above all, a woman growing daily in God’s grace.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created this blog because I believe each of us is constantly becoming — learning, 
                unlearning, healing, building, failing forward, and allowing God to shape us into who 
                He has called us to be.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, you will find a blend of:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Faith & Identity</b> — discovering who we are in Christ</li>
                <li><b>Tech Journey</b> — my experiences as a CS student</li>
                <li><b>Mindset & Motivation</b> — quotes, reflections, and life lessons</li>
                <li><b>Stories</b> — creative writing and short stories with meaning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                My prayer is simple:  
                That something here speaks to your heart. That you leave each post feeling encouraged, 
                strengthened, and reminded that you are becoming — daily, slowly, beautifully — by the grace 
                of God.  
                Welcome to <b>Becoming by Grace</b>. Let’s grow together.

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                Hi, I’m <b>Norah Chisha</b>, a passionate Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer.  
                Beyond learning code and algorithms, I am a motivational writer, and a lover of God who believes in 
                living with purpose and intention.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started this blog to share my journey — spiritually, mentally, and academically. My mission 
                is simple: to inspire, uplift, and encourage others to become who God has called them to be.  
                Through faith, mindset growth, and personal development, I hope to be a light to someone 
                navigating their own path.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether it’s tech lessons, spiritual reflections, creative writing, or motivation, everything 
                I share comes from a place of authenticity and growth. I’m still becoming — and I believe you 
                are too.
            </p>

            <p><b>Welcome once again. Let’s grow together.</b></p>
