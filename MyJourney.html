            <h1>What is Grace</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Definition:</h2>
            <p>
                Grace is the unmerited favor of God toward humanity. It is not earned by works, effort, or
                 human merit, but freely given by God out of His love. Grace transforms, sustains, and empowers
                  believers to live in alignment with God’s will.

            <h2>2. Key Scripture:</h2>
            <p><strong>John 1:16-17 (ESV):</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                “For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses;
                 grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>This passage shows that grace is abundant and comes through Jesus, surpassing the law’s mere instruction.</p>

            <p><strong>John 1:15-18 (ESV) Explained:</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                “John testified about him, and cried out,This was he of whom I said, “He who comes after me ranks before me, 
                because he was before me.”’ For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given 
                through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the
                 Father’s side, he has made him known.”
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jesus embodies grace in its fullest form.</li>
                <li>John highlights the contrast: the law gave rules; Jesus brings grace and truth.</li>
                <li>Grace is a gift from God’s fullness, not dependent on human effort.</li>
                <li>It reveals God’s nature and makes salvation possible for humanity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Grace in Salvation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV):</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.”
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Salvation is purely by God’s grace.</li>
                <li>Even if we are undeserving, grace covers our shortcomings.</li>
                <li>Faith is the conduit through which we receive grace—it is trusting God’s unearned favor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How Grace Works in Our Lives</h2>

            <h3>Grace Saves</h3>
            <p>Without grace, we are separated from God because of sin.</p>
            <p><strong>Romans 3:23-24:</strong> “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.”</p>

            <h3>Grace Strengthens</h3>
            <p><strong>2 Corinthians 12:9:</strong> “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</p>
            <p>God’s grace empowers us when we feel inadequate or weak.</p>

            <h3>Grace Transforms</h3>
            <p><strong>Titus 2:11-12:</strong> “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age.”</p>
            <p>Grace doesn’t just save—it molds our character and lifestyle.</p>

            <h3>Grace Forgives</h3>
            <p><strong>Hebrews 4:16:</strong> “Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”</p>
            <p>We approach God knowing we are forgiven, not because we earned it, but because He is gracious.</p>

            <h2>5. Personal Reflection</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Sometimes we are not deserving of many things, but it only takes the grace of God to make us who we are today.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>Grace allows us to rise above limitations, mistakes, and failures.</p>
            <p>It reminds us that our journey is not based on perfection but on God’s unmerited favor.</p>
            <p>Grace empowers us to begin, continue, and complete the journey God has set for us.</p>
